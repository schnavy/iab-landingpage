                The Academy of Fine Arts Leipzig as well as this event are co-financed by tax money on the basis of the
                budget passed by the members of the Saxon state parliament. This poster was designed by Emil Kowalczyk
                and Merle Petsch and printed by HGB Graphic Workshops.
